Play this game to improve your memory. 

Press any key on your keyboard to start.

This game creates a series of flashes and requires a user to repeat the pattern/sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex and the user has to keep track of the previous sequence to progress. Once the user fails, the screen turns red and says "Game over" and restarts to level 1. 

This game was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.
